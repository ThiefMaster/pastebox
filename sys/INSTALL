Installing PasteBox is pretty easy.
Requirements:
* PHP 5
* PHP-PDO enabled
* Turned off magic_quotes and register_globals
* .htaccess being enabled

Options:
* Default - Sqlite3 installed for PHP-PDO
* MySQL and any other database engine supported by PDO

Installing:
1. Extract the archive (or download through SVN)
2. Go to the web browser and open sys/setup.php
3. You are done.

You might need to update permissions for sys/xmain.db to make sure that it is writable with the web server's user - such as www-data. To do this, you will need to execute:
  chmod +w sys/xmain.db
If writing is still not possible, you may need to change the user groups with root:
  chgrp www-data sys
  chgrp www-data sys/xmain.db
  chmod ug+w sys/xmain.db

If you want to customise more, please edit the sys/config.inc.php
configuration file.

Debian/Ubuntu installation bits:
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5 php5 php5-sqlite
sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 force-reload
