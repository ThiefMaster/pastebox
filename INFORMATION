# REQUIREMENTS #
 * PHP 5
 * A web server
 * Regular expressions through regex
 * Local system file reading and writing

# PasteBox #
Paste your snippets of code easily and with great performance. The contents
are put into static files, so you don't really have to worry about large memory
usage like in the previous version of PasteBox or many other Pastebin scripts
out there that use MySQL or other dynamic database engines to process every single
request.
With this new version comes less dependency, meaning that all you really need to
have ready is a webserver and the PHP interpreter - no fussy module and database
installations.

# INSTALLATION #
To install the software, after extracting, all you need to do is to visit the
file 'new.php' through your web browser. Then, 'index.html' will be generated,
which serves as the entry submission and recent entry listing page.
You will need to turn off magic_quotes_gpc and register_globals (to see how,
just visit the 'new.php' page). It should be done by default anyway, because
of serious security concerns present in many PHP software packages.
Don't forget to enable write access to the webserver, it is crucial.

# HOW IT WORKS #
The data is submitted through 'index.html', and directed to 'new.php'. This
file then creates a new paste entry as an HTML file and as a text file for 
convenience. Then, the new file is added to the recent submissions list, which
is located in '.recent' and its contents are shown as a list in 'index.html'.

# CUSTOMIZATION #
Update the file 'new.php' to customize any necessarily settings. The only 
thing you, as a user, should be aware of is that the changes only take place
after new entries are submitted, and the previous ones are not affected at all.
This is because all of the pages are statically generated and not updated.

Certain entries are removed after they have 'expired'. The options are
descripbed in 'new.php'.

# CHANGES #
The new PasteBox v1.0.0 is a complete re-write of the previous PasteBox.
The list of the significant changes:
 * Static content caching - improves the performance of the server
 * No database required
 * Integrated simple captcha - disable it if you are using it in the local environment
 * Located in a single functional file
 * Simpler multiple language support
 * More customization abilities
 * Less menu items
 * Pointers for modification
 * Uses buffer caching for any dynamic pages
 * Removed feed support (will be brought back if any users really want it)
